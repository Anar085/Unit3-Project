## Problem definition
My client Ritsu operates a big-sized Turkish restaurant focused on delivering high-quality dining experience. To improve efficiency and minimize order-processing errors, they need a digital POS restaurant order management system with two separate interfaces—one for waiters and another for administrators. The system features a monitor placed near the kitchen, where waiters can log in and take customer orders. Once the meal is prepared and served to the customer, the waiter should print the bill for payment, get the payment from customer, and bring the money (or the receipt if paid by the bank card) and the bill to the cash register. Once administrator seating in the cash register figures out that everything was fine about serving, he/she can finalize the order, which automatically sets the table's status to be "Available" in the pos system. But in the case waiter made a mistake on his/her order, it is not possible for them to cancel the order as it prevents first corruption, in case where waiter can get the payment and cancel order, which makes the order "disappear" from the track of orders, and second the possible chaos in the kitchen caused by the preparation of "canceled" order. If a user logs in as an administrator, they gain additional privileges, such as the ability to cancel orders, view and edit ongoing orders.
